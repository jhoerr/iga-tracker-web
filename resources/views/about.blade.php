        <p>
        Ping the People is a free and <a href="https://github.com/pingthepeople">open source</a> project built with love by two Bloomington citizen-nerds, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnhoerr">John Hoerr</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ohnoitsaustin">Austin Lord</a>. We are dedicated to the proposition that it should be easy for Hoosiers to keep tabs on what's happening in the Indiana Statehouse. If you have any questions or comments, please email us at <a href="mailto:help@pingthepeople.org?Subject=Question/comment" target="_top">help@pingthepeople.org</a> or tweet us @pingthepeople.
